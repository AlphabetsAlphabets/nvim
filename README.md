It's very simple, and very minimal. No autocompletion, only manual completion with [completions](https://neovim.io/doc/user/usr_24.html#24.3) as I prefer to keep things as minimal as possible. Nothing against people who do, it's just that after I lost a lot of my data, I decided that configurating everything ain't worth the hassle.
