-- we start by calling run and giving it our colorscheme as the first argument.
-- any other arguments form the pipeline.
run(colorscheme,

  -- now we will convert that colorscheme to a list of vimscript highlight commands
  lushwright.to_vimscript,

  -- we can pass the vimscript through a vim compatible transform if we want.
  -- note: this strips blending
  -- lushwright.vim_compatible_vimscript,

  -- the vimscript commands alone are generally not enough for a colorscheme, we
  -- will need to append a few housekeeping lines first.
  --
  -- note how we are passing arguments to append by wrapping the transform in a table.
  -- {transform 1 2 3} ends up as transform(last_pipe_value, 1, 2, 3)
  --
  -- append() accepts a table of values, or one value, so this call ends up being:
  -- append(last_pipe_value, {"set...",  "let..."})
  {append, {"set background=dark", "let g:colors_name=\"my_colorscheme\""}},

  -- now we are ready to write our colors file. note: there is no reason this has
  -- to be written to the relative "colors" dir, you could write the file to an
  -- entirely different vim plugin.
  {overwrite, "/home/yjh/.config/nvim/colors/lex.vim"})

-- and that is the whole build file
